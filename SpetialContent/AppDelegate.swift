 Solution takes a chat message string and returns a JSON string containing information about its contents. Special content to look for includes:
 
 1. @mentions - A way to mention a user. Always starts with an '@' and ends when hitting a non-word character.
 
 2. Emoticons - 'custom' emoticons which are alphanumeric strings, no longer than 15 characters, contained in parenthesis.
 
 3. Links - Any URLs contained in the message, along with the page's title.
 
 For example, calling your function with the following inputs should result in the corresponding return values.
 
 Input: "@chris you around?"
 Return (string):
 { "mentions": [ "chris" ] }
 
 Input: "Good morning! (megusta) (coffee)"
 Return (string):
 { "emoticons": [ "megusta", "coffee" ] }
 
 Input: "Olympics are starting soon; http://www.nbcolympics.com"
 Return (string):
 { "links": [
        { "url": "http://www.nbcolympics.com", "title": "NBC Olympics | 2014 NBC Olympics in Sochi Russia" }
    ]
 }
 
 Input: "@bob @john (success) such a cool feature; https://twitter.com/jdorfman/status/430511497475670016"
 Return (string):
 { "mentions": [
        "bob",
        "john"
    ],
 "emoticons": [
        "success"
    ],
 "links": [
        { "url": "https://twitter.com/jdorfman/status/430511497475670016", "title": "Twitter / jdorfman: nice @littlebigdetail from ..." }
    ]
